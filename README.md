‘The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target”,
It is based on the work of psychologist Paul Fitts in 1954.

Jakob’s law recommends the use of familiar patterns in design, to facilitate a better user experience.

It means that sometimes your urge to create something unique and fancy might hamper the user experience simply because the user is not familiar with it.

Fitts’s Law

Zeigarnic Effect

This happens with all of us, when we have some important task to do, and when we forget to do it, we tend to feel bad about it; this is the zeigarnik effect.
It states that we remember uncompleted and uninterrupted tasks more than the completed task.

Hick's law

The time taken to arrive at a decision increases with the number of choices. The complexity of choices also affects the time.

For a better UX experience, you should simplify the options by breaking them into tiny steps. Don’t overwhelm the user with complex choices.

The more choices you offer, the user may take a long time to respond and lose their attention span in the process.

So, reduce the complexity and the number of choices as much as possible.

80/20

The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle is a fascinating theory which claims that 20% of your effort can yield 80% of the results. This indicates that everything can be done more efficiently, we should focus most of our time on the critical areas that bring the largest benefit. This was first observed with a study showing 20% of the Italian population possessed 80% of the wealth.
