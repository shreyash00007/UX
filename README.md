‘The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target”,
It is based on the work of psychologist Paul Fitts in 1954.

Jakob’s law recommends the use of familiar patterns in design, to facilitate a better user experience.

It means that sometimes your urge to create something unique and fancy might hamper the user experience simply because the user is not familiar with it.

Fitts’s Law
Touch targets should be easily accessible and clear.

When computers were still relatively new, and people once dreamed of going to space, Paul M. You could find a lot of theories written over the past 66 years, but the bottom line

Zeigarnic Effect

This happens with all of us, when we have some important task to do, and when we forget to do it, we tend to feel bad about it; this is the zeigarnik effect.
It states that we remember uncompleted and uninterrupted tasks more than the completed task.

Hick's law

The time taken to arrive at a decision increases with the number of choices. The complexity of choices also affects the time.

For a better UX experience, you should simplify the options by breaking them into tiny steps. Don’t overwhelm the user with complex choices.

The more choices you offer, the user may take a long time to respond and lose their attention span in the process.

So, reduce the complexity and the number of choices as much as possible.

80/20

The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle is a fascinating theory which claims that 20% of your effort can yield 80% of the results. This indicates that everything can be done more efficiently, we should focus most of our time on the critical areas that bring the largest benefit. This was first observed with a study showing 20% of the Italian population possessed 80% of the wealth. 

Law of Prägnanz

Also called “Law of simplicity”, which states that users perceive complex forms in the simplest way because it is the interpretation that requires less mental effort.

Basically, it describes that it is easier to understand and assimilate a square than an octagon. And it requires less mental intensity to obtain an appreciation of what that is and what it is for. A practical example of this would be the following.

Serial Position Effect

According to this law, among the elements of a series, users will always remember better the first one and the last one.

And that is the reason why we see that in the application navigation bar, the most important actions are placed on the left or on the right, introducing elements such as start or profile taking into account the serial position.

A practical example of this law would be in Instagram.

Law of Proximity

Objects that are close tend to join, and in the user experience, they are understood as members of the same group.

The principle holds that if you are handling a group of data, all the data that we understand that correspond to the same group should be together and if we start talking about different data there should be a space (air) between them. Our head will do the rest and differentiate them.

An example of this would be…

Tesler’s Law

Also known as ‘conservation of complexity’, by Larry Tesler. It establishes that for any system there is a certain complexity that can not be reduced to the maximum.

Every UX designer would like to simplify processes and make them faster, but we have to take into account that there are things that cannot be simplified to be more basic. (Unless the format changes).

We would find an example in any agency to buy tickets.

Law of Closure

Our brains tend to fill in the information and avoid contradictions as much as possible.

Our eyes are naturally drawn to simpler ways to see things. When viewing a complex arrangement of visual elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern or shape.

The principle of closure is often used to design logos and icons that are both memorable and recognizable. This state that you work in your memory and convert the complex object into easy ones.


Law of Focal Point

You’d be surprised at how much information can be conveyed visually in just a single second.

The focal point principle states that whatever stands out visually will capture and retain the attention of viewers first. This principle is common in graphic design, where elements like contrast, color, and visual emphasis are used to draw attention to an element. The element that is highlighted than the surrounding holds the user’s attention first, like the below image you noticed the duck first.

Law of Continuity

Items placed in a certain row or direction are seen as a group

The principle of continuity states that while elements may appear to be indescribably related, line or curve grouping often increases their relation by making them appear to be similar in terms of position and direction.

Law of Similarity
Similar elements of the design tend to look related, even if they are separated

When elements appear to be similar to each other, we tend to group them and give them the same function.

Although those elements look the same and are evenly spaced, we tend to group them by color.

This example showcases how you can use buttons to create a clear and unobstructed user interface.

When elements appear to be similar to each other, we tend to group them and give them the same function.

Zeigarnik Effect

Adopt progress measurements in your design because users remember incomplete tasks better than completed tasks

Starting a task creates task-related tension that’s felt when the job is interrupted or incomplete. All the tension from a highly repetitive task makes it difficult to complete the work itself, but that very difficulty and

Tesler’s Law

Any system has a complexity that cannot be simplified

Each design has a certain level of complexity to it. You are responsible for reducing complexity in your organization and across the entire supply chain. By removing unnecessary features or tweaking the way your app works, you can help users focus on the actual task at hand instead of figuring out how to navigate the design.

Aesthetic Usability Effect

The Aesthetic Usability Effect explains that people often perceive visually appealing design as more intuitive and usable than those that are considered less pleasing on the eye, people believe that things that look better, will work better. Majority of the time customers will be more tolerant of minor issues when the design is aesthetically pleasing, this is due to the positive emotional response they feel. This also correlates to the theory of the Attractiveness Bias, which shows we are drawn to beauty. This highlights how imperative a well-polished user interface is, in conjunction with a solid UX.


Von Restorff Effect

A visually distinctive item is easily remembered when presented along with multiple similar items

The Von Restorff Effect is the tendency to remember the most distinctive elements of a group. It’s called The Isolation Effect, as an object that stands out becomes more memorable to us than other items that look similar.
