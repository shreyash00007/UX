Its about ux 

‘The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target”,
It is based on the work of psychologist Paul Fitts in 1954.

Jakob’s law recommends the use of familiar patterns in design, to facilitate a better user experience.

It means that sometimes your urge to create something unique and fancy might hamper the user experience simply because the user is not familiar with it.

Fitts’s Law
Touch targets should be easily accessible and clear.

When computers were still relatively new, and people once dreamed of going to space, Paul M. You could find a lot of theories written over the past 66 years, but the bottom line

Zeigarnic Effect

This happens with all of us, when we have some important task to do, and when we forget to do it, we tend to feel bad about it; this is the zeigarnik effect.
It states that we remember uncompleted and uninterrupted tasks more than the completed task.

Hick's law

The time taken to arrive at a decision increases with the number of choices. The complexity of choices also affects the time.

For a better UX experience, you should simplify the options by breaking them into tiny steps. Don’t overwhelm the user with complex choices.

The more choices you offer, the user may take a long time to respond and lose their attention span in the process.

So, reduce the complexity and the number of choices as much as possible.

80/20

The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle is a fascinating theory which claims that 20% of your effort can yield 80% of the results. This indicates that everything can be done more efficiently, we should focus most of our time on the critical areas that bring the largest benefit. This was first observed with a study showing 20% of the Italian population possessed 80% of the wealth. 

Law of Prägnanz

Also called “Law of simplicity”, which states that users perceive complex forms in the simplest way because it is the interpretation that requires less mental effort.

Basically, it describes that it is easier to understand and assimilate a square than an octagon. And it requires less mental intensity to obtain an appreciation of what that is and what it is for. A practical example of this would be the following.

Serial Position Effect

According to this law, among the elements of a series, users will always remember better the first one and the last one.

And that is the reason why we see that in the application navigation bar, the most important actions are placed on the left or on the right, introducing elements such as start or profile taking into account the serial position.

A practical example of this law would be in Instagram.
