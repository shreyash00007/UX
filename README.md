Its about ux 

‘The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target”,
It is based on the work of psychologist Paul Fitts in 1954.

Jakob’s law recommends the use of familiar patterns in design, to facilitate a better user experience.

It means that sometimes your urge to create something unique and fancy might hamper the user experience simply because the user is not familiar with it.
